# description of projects
These are my three projects.
Good Cardboard and Web Agency made using a valid cross-platform and cross-browser layout. An adaptation for mobile devices was made up to a minimum screen width of 320 pixels. During development, I used: gully, sass, bootstrap grid, jQuery. The files css and html are not minimized so you can see the structure. 
Project StartUp was made without an adaptive.
